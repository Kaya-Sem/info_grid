## Introduction

Welcome to the *Advanced Networking* section of the ThreeFold Manual.

In this section, we provide advanced networking tips for farms with public IPs and in data centers.

## Data Center Cable Management

It's important to have a good cable management, specially if you are in a data center. Proper cable management will improve the cooling streams of your farm. There shouldn't be any cable in front of the fans. This way, your servers will last longer. If you want to patch a rack, you have to have all lenght of patch cables from 30cm to 3m. Also, try to keep the cables as short as possible. Arrange the cables in bundles of eight and lead them to the sides of the rack as much as possible for optimal airflow.
