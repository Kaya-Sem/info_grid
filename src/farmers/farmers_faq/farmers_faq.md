## TFT Farming Basics

### How can I create a ThreeFold farm?

There are two ways to create a ThreeFold farm.

You can install the [ThreeFold Connect App](#is-there-a-threefold-app-for-mobile), set an account and then create a farm in the section Farming.

You can also create a ThreeFold farm on the [ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/) after having created an account on the [Polkadot extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

***

### My Titan is v2.1 and the ThreeFold Grid is v3., what is the distinction?

Titan v2.1 is the hardware. Before v2.1, there was 2.0. The hardware currently being shipped is the Titan v2.1.

When you read v3, it refers to the ThreeFold Grid. Titans are now being sent ready for TF Grid v3 so they are being referred to as Titan v3. In short, the current Titans are v2.1 hardware ready for ThreeFold Grid v3.

***
### Is there a way to know the current TFT price for the farming rewards?

Yes! Go [here](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__farming_reward?id=farming-reward-calculation) and scroll down, you'll be able to find the TFT price at the line: current TFT to USD price.

***

### When will I receive the farming rewards for my 3Nodes?

Farming rewards are usually sent around the 8th of each month. This can vary slightly because the verification process is not yet fully automated.

For more information on the minting process, read the next [QnA](#what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated).

***

### What is the TFT minting process? Is it fully automated?

Minting is based on blockchain data according to strict rules that are carried out by computers with humans involved only to check for errors and to sign the resulting transactions.

There is a human verification mechanism through multisignatures for calculations done on the data as stored in the blockchain. This explains the timing differences when it comes to the monthly farming rewards distribution, since enough people need to sign off.

The detailed minting process for V3 is as follow:

- TFChain, ThreeFold's blockchain, has all the details about capacity provided by the nodes.
- TFChain is used to track uptime.
- Zero-OS reports to TFChain.
- The code in [this repo](https://github.com/threefoldtech/minting_v3) uses the information from the blockchain to calculate the TFT to be minted.
- A proof of what needs to be minted and why is created. This proof is then sent to our guardians.
- The guardians need to double check the execution and the minting report. This is like a human check on the automated process.
- The guardians need to sign. Only when consensus is achieved the minting as suggested will happen. This allows human to check the code.

It is important to understant that TFChain tracks the capacity and uptime and is the source for the minting.

Note: Additional auditing code will be added in V4 (i.e. special code generated at runtime for verification) using security primitives on motherboards.

For more information on the minting periods, read this [QnA](#what-is-the-start-and-end-of-the-current-minting-period-what-are-the-minting-periods-for-threefold-farming-in-2023).

***

### What should I do if I did not receive my farming rewards this month?

If you did not receive your farming rewards, please contact us via our live chats. We will then investigate the situation. 

You can find our live chat option on the TF Connect App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en_CA&gl=US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885)), the [TF Forum](http://forum.threefold.io/), [TF Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/) and the [TF website](https://threefold.io/). 
For the TF Connect app, select the Support option.
For the other websites, it is a blue icon on the right bottom part of the page.

The easiest way to contact the ThreeFold support is to use [this link](https://threefoldfaq.crisp.help/en/) and click on the chat icon.

***

### Is there a ThreeFold simulator to calculate farming rewards?

Of course! Go to the [ThreeFold Simulator](https://simulator.grid.tf/) and select DIY or Titan.
***
### What is the TFT entry price of my 3Node farming rewards?

Currently, the TFT entry price of the 3Nodes' farming rewards is 8 cents (0.08 USD).

***

### What is the necessary uptime for a 3Node per period of one month?

Note that as of now, rewards are proportional to the uptime, so (e.g.) 40% uptime farms 40% of the total uptime period.

When implemented : For certified Titans 3Nodes, it is 97% uptime per month (21.6h). For DIY 3Nodes, it is 95% uptime per month (36h). For professional certified 3 nodes, it is 99.5% uptime per month (3.6h). 
***

### How can I check the uptime of my 3Nodes? Is there a tool to check the uptime of 3Node servers on the ThreeFold Grid?

You can go on the [ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/), and select "Farms" in the Portal menu.  When you select a specific 3Node in your farm, you can see a visual graph of the 3Node's uptime of the last month. By clicking on "Node Statistics", you can see past and present uptime periods.

To check uptime, you can also use [this tool](http://publicuptime.tfcloud.us/uptimeCheck) made by a TF community member. This tool is also available with the Planetary Network [here](http://uptime.tfcloud.us/uptimeCheck). This link works when you are connected to the Planetary Network.

***

### I set up a 3Node in the middle of the month, does it affect uptime requirements and rewards?

You will still need to meet the required uptime (95% for DIY, etc.3), but the period starts when you connected the 3Node for the first time, instead of the usual start of the month. This only applies the first month. Afterwards, the uptime is calculated on the whole month. *Read last Q+A

***
### What is the difference between a certified and a non-certified 3Node?

A certified 3Node will receive 25% more reward compared to a non-certified 3Node. 
You can visit the [ThreeFold Marketplace](https://marketplace.3node.global/) for more information on certified 3Nodes. 
DIY certified 3Nodes are a future possibility.

***

### What are the different certifications available for 3Node servers and farms? What are the Gold and Silver certifications?

3Nodes can be certified. You can buy certified 3Nodes [here](https://marketplace.3node.global/).

Farms can also be certified. The certifications are: [gold certified farming](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-gold-certified-farming-specs-closed/2925) and [silver certified farming](https://forum.threefold.io/t/silver-booster-request-for-comments/3416).

Note that gold and silver certifications are still being discussed. Join the discussion on the [ThreeFold Forum](http://forum.threefold.io/).

### What is the difference between V2 and V3 minting?

V2 is being sunset. New miners should directly onboard to V3.
On the tokenomics side, V2 rewards decrease as the difficulty level increases. For the V3 rewards, the rewards are constant for 5 years. In short, V3 is more profitable in the long run. For more information, read [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/comparison-v2-vs-v3-minting/2122). 

***

### How long is the minting period of the tokens on ThreeFold? How long is the farming period?

Each period has: 2630880 seconds = 43848 minutes = 730.8 hours. For more info, read [this](../faq/faq.md#what-is-the-start-and-end-of-the-current-minting-period-what-are-the-minting-periods-for-threefold-farming-in-2023).

### What is the TFT minting address on Stellar Chain?

The TFT minting address on Stellar Chain is the following: GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

You can see it on the Stellar Explorer [here](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47). 

***

### Can Titans and DIY 3Nodes share the same farm?

Yes. It's one big ThreeFold family! A farm can have several 3Nodes (Titans or DIY) and each 3Node can be linked to only one farm.

***

### Do I need one farm for each 3Node?

No. You only need one farm. One farm can have multiple 3Nodes. When setting your farm, you will add an address for the farming rewards. All farming rewards from each 3Node of your farm will be sent to this address. Note that you can choose to have more than one farm. It is up to you.

***

### Can a single farm be composed of many 3Nodes?

Yes. You can have many 3Nodes on the same farm.

***

### Can a single 3Node be on more than one farm?

No, this is not possible.

***

### Do I need one reward address per 3Node?

You do not need more than one address linked to one farm. All of your 3Nodes can be connected to the same farm. Rewards per each 3Nodes will all be sent to the address linked to your farm.

***

### When it comes to the Zero-OS bootstrap image, can I simply duplicate the first image I burnt when I build another 3Node?

Yes. What is needed on this bootstrap image is to have the proper farm ID. The bootstrap image will be the same for all your different 3Nodes. It's a good TF farming practice to leave the bootstrap image plugged in the 3Node at all time.

***

### If a node is unused for certain time (e.g. many months offline), will it be erased by the Grid?

No, nodes only get deleted if the farm owner chooses to do so. Old "nodes" are really just entries in TF Chain and TF Chain does not modify or delete this data without external input.

***

### Can a farm be erased from TF Grid?

No, this is not possible. In the future, we will implement some features in order to allow the cleaning of unused farms. As of now, this is not possible. Also, an old farm does not take resources on the TF Grid, or very little. 

***

### On the ThreeFold Connect App, it says I need to migrate my Titan farm from V2 to V3. What do I have to do? How long does this take?

You simply need to press on the button *Migrate to V3* on the ThreeFold Connect App to migrate your Titan to V3.
This process usually takes a couple of minutes but it can take a little bit longer. 

***


### How can I migrate my DIY farm from V2 to V3?

Create a new [bootstrap image](https://bootstrap.grid.tf/) using your new V3 Farm ID. To create a new V3 Farm ID, you can use the ThreeFold Connect App or the ThreeFold Dashboard.

***

### What does the pricing policy ID of a farm represent?

The pricing policy is the definition of how the network bills for workloads (pricing for each resource type, discounts, etc.).

***

### What is the difference between TiB and TB? Why doesn't the TF Explorer shows the same storage space as my disk?

Terabyte (TB) and Tebibyte (TiB) are units of digital information used to measure storage capacity and data transfer rate. While terabyte is a decimal standard unit, Tebibyte is binary. 

* 1 TB = 1000^4 bytes
* 1 TiB = 1024^4 bytes. 

There are thus more bytes in 1 TiB than in 1 TB. 
1 TiB is equal to 1.099511627776 TB.

You can play around these 2 notions by exploring this [TiB-TB converter](https://www.dataunitconverter.com/tebibyte-to-terabyte/).

You can also check [this table](https://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/kb/why-does-my-hard-drive-report-less-capacity-than-indicated-on-the-drives-label-172191en/) to compare different OS system's storage representation.

***

## Farming Rewards and Related Notions

### What are the rewards of farming? Can I get more rewards when my 3Node is being utilized?

By connecting a 3Node to the Grid, you get Farming Rewards. If you set a public IP address for the Grid to use, you will receive additional rewards when your 3Node is being utilized by users on the Grid. All rewards are paid in TFT. To know the potential rewards, use the [simulator](https://simulator.grid.tf/). More information on sales channel will be communicated in the future.

***

### How can I know the potential farming rewards for Grid Utilization?

Go on the [ThreeFold simulator](https://simulator.grid.tf/), enter your 3Node resources, check the Public IP address. This will enable farming rewards from the parameter NU Required Per CU. Check the difference in the farming rewards per month. Note that you will need a Public IP address.

***

### What is the easiest way to farm ThreeFold tokens (TFT)?

Buy a [certified 3Node](https://marketplace.3node.global/index.php). This is more or less *plug n play*! You can also build a [DIY 3Node](#what-are-the-general-requirements-for-a-diy-3node-server). It's fun and there are many resources to help you along the way.

***

### When do I receive my rewards?

They are distributed once a month, around the 8th*. Distributions are not daily, or after a certain threshold. Note that upcoming minting rules may have a 24 month lockup or until 30% utilization for 3 months on your 3Node. 

*This can change slightly depending on the current situation.

***

### On ThreeFold Grid v3, how can I verify my 3Nodes' payments on Stellar Blockchain?

Here's the summary on how to find the details of a 3Node's payment:

1. Go to https://stellar.expert

2. Open the hamburger menu on the top right (mobile version)

3. Paste your wallet address in the search bar

4. Go to the last payment you want details of
   
5. Make sure the Memo (HASH) is in the HEX format. If it isn't click on *base64* and change it to *hex*.

6. Copy the Memo (HASH)

7. Go to https://alpha.minting.tfchain.grid.tf/

8. Paste the Memo (HASH) you copied. You will find the details of the 3Node's payment

NB: A full period is 2630880 seconds.

***

### Do farming rewards take into account the type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU of the 3Node server?

No. The farming rewards do not take into account the specific type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU. The farming rewards take into account the quantity of storage and compute units (e.g. TB of SSD/HDD, GB of RAM, # of virtual cores).

***

### What is the farming reward calculation?

The general calculation is the following:

    TFT earned per month = 
    CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
    + SU farmed * SU farming rewards
    + NU used * NU farming rewards
    + IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards


Lear more about this [here](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__proof_of_capacity).

> Note: The farming rewards take into account the quantity of storage and compute units (e.g. TB of SSD/HDD, GB of RAM, # of virtual cores). The farming rewards do not take into account the specific type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU.

***

### Can I send my farming rewards directly to a crypto exchange?

This is not possible. When you send tokens to a crypto exchange, you need to include a memo with your wallet address and the current farming rewards system of ThreeFold is already using that memo space to send the correct farming information.
***
### I received my farming rewards, now I want to sell my ThreeFold tokens (TFT). How can I do this?

First, know that your TFT farming rewards are on the Stellar Blockchain. If you want to sell on Pancakeswap (on the Binance Chain), you will need to use the Stellar-BSC Bridge, where a 50 TFT fees is applicable. See the section *How to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge* in the [ThreeFold Farming Guide](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge) for more information on this method.

If you stay on Stellar blockchain, you can either swap your TFT, for example on [StellarX](https://stellarx.com/swap), where some XLM will be needed, or sell your TFT on an exchange using the Stellar blockchain. Currently, this can be done on [BTC-Alpha](https://btc-alpha.com). First, send your TFT to your exchange wallet and make sure you enter the memo correctly. Once your TFT are on the exchange, you can sell them on the market. Make sure to follow the exchange specific steps where applicable.

***

### Which wallets are recommended for ThreeFold token (TFT) farming rewards?

The most straightforward wallet possible when it comes to farming TFT is simply to use the wallet included with the ThreeFold Connect App. It is also possible to use other wallets that are connected to the Stellar Blockchain. In these cases, you will need to establish a trustline with TFT. You can also store your TFT on a Ledger or a Trezor via the Stellar Blockchain. See stellarterm.com, stellarx.com and solarwallet.io.

***

### Can I have more details on storing ThreeFold tokens (TFT) on hardware wallets?

Yes of course! In short, you will need to use a hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor/etc.) to sign in, add TFT as an asset (trustline), then send TFT to the Stellar address. For more information, read the section [Setting up a TFT Trustline on Stellar Blockchain](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#setting-up-a-tft-trustline-on-stellar-blockchain) from the Farming documentation.

***


### Do I need collateral to farm ThreeFold tokens?

Many decentralized data projects require collateral, but not ThreeFold. There is an ongoing discussion on collateral. Join the discussion [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/should-tft-collateral-be-required-for-3nodes/3724).

***
### Can I add external drives to the 3Nodes to increase rewards and resources available to the ThreeFold Grid?

As of now, you cannot add external drives to a 3Nodes. It is not yet supported. It might be in the future and we will update the FAQ if/when this happens.

***

### Do I have access to the TFT rewards I receive each month when farming?

For now, V3 farming rewards are distributed as TFT on Stellar and they are immediately available. The lock system will be implemented on chain. Tokens will be staked to your address until unlock conditions are met. Conditions are: 2 years of farming or 30% of proof-of-utilization for 3 months per 3Node. 

***

### What is TFTA? Is it still used?

Note that on V3, TFTA will not be issued anymore. 

***

###  Is there a way to certify a DIY 3Node? How can I become a 3Node certified vendor and builder?

As of now, only certified ThreeFold partners can certify a 3Node. You could become a ThreeFolder vendor and offer certified 3Node. Read more [here](https://marketplace.3node.global/index.php?dispatch=companies.apply_for_vendor).

***

### Does it make sense to make my farm a company?

There is no general answer to this. Here's what a ThreeFold member thinks about this if you are living in the USA. Check for your current location if this makes sense for you. DYOR.

> "Definitely do this project as a business entity. You can write off equipment, utilities and a portion of your home's square footage if your are hosting the equipment at home." TFarmer

***

### What is the difference between uptime and downtime, and between online and offline, when it comes to 3Nodes?

Uptime and status are two different things. As long as the 3Node is powered on, its uptime does not reset. Its status changes to offline if it hasn't made an uptime report in the last two hours. Even if after more than two hours, the 3Node isn't yet online, the uptime does not reset. Uptime is a function of the system being powered on.
***

### My 3Node server grid utilization is low, is it normal?

This is normal. Currently, not all 3Nodes are being utilized by users on the ThreeFold Grid. Each month, more and more utilization happens and the ThreeFold Grid continually expans. To read on the ThreeFold Grid utilization and expansion, check this [TF Forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/grid-stats-new-nodes-utilization-overview/3291).


***

## 3Node Farming Requirements

### What are the general requirements for a DIY 3Node server?

Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip can run Zero-OS and become a 3Node. For a complete guide on building a 3Node, read the [Farming Guide](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md). The following configurations provide guidelines on compatible and recommended setups:

- Servers, desktops and mini computers type hardware are compatible.
- A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.
- A ratio of 1:4 between vCPU and RAM (e.g. 8vCPU and 32 GB of RAM) is recommended.
- The recommended upper limit is 8 GB of RAM per vCPU as farming rewards do not increase beyond that ratio.
- A wired ethernet connection is highly recommended to maximize reliability and the ability to farm TFT.

***

### What kind of computer do I need to make a 3Node server?

Any modern computer should be sufficient, especially once you upgrade the amount of RAM and storage to increase your TFT rewards. While CPU specs are not currently measured, they may be in the future. To insure your 3Node provides meaningful capacity to the network, you should have at least 1000 CPU passmark per core as measured on https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php

***

### I found a decent computer (or server) to buy online, but it doesn't come with a CPU. How can I know what CPU models would work with a specific computer or server?

You can usually find this information in the owner manual of the server in the section Technical Specifications. Here's a link for [Dell servers](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000144474/poweredge-servers-supported-processors-cpus-and-where-to-find-technical-specifications).


***
### Can I host more than one 3Node server at my house?

Yes, but do not host more than your bandwidth can support.

***

### Is Wifi supported? Can I farm via Wifi instead of an Ethernet cable?

No. Wifi is not supported by Zero-OS due to a number of issues, like reliability, performance, configuration requirements and driver support. It's all about Ethernet cables here.

***

### Is there any way to run Zero-OS without DHCP?

You can set up a node through static routing at the router without DHCP by assigning the MAC address of the NIC to a IP address within your private subnet. This will give a static IP address to your 3Node.


***

### I have 2 routers with each a different Internet service provider. I disconnected the ethernet cable from one router and connected it to the other router. Do I need to reboot the 3Node?

You do not need to reboot. The 3Node will be able to reconnect to the ThreeFold Grid.


***

### Do I need any specific port configuration when booting a 3Node?

No, as long as the 3Node is connected to the Internet via an ethernet cable (wifi is not supported), Zero-OS will be able to boot. Usually with the DHCP, it automatically assigns an IP address.

***

### How much electricity does a 3Node use?

A small DIY 3Node based on a compact office computer will draw under 20W. A full size server will draw around 100W idling. Note that a 3Node actively used on the Grid (proof-of-utilization) will draw more power, but also generate passive income on top of farming if you have a public IP address. 

For more information, read thes section [Calculate the Total Electricity Cost of Your Farm](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#calculate-the-total-electricity-cost-of-your-farm) of the Farming Guide.

***

### Has anyone run stress tests to know the power consumption at heavy load of certain 3Nodes?

The community is starting to gather some data on this. As of now, we know that a R720 with 2x2690v2 cpu, 4TB NVME SSE P4510 and 320GB ram will draw 390W @100% load. With 2x2650L v2, it's around 300W with fans at full speed. More info will be added as we gather more data.

***

### How much AC power do you need (in BTU) to compensate for the heat generated by the 3Node servers? How can I ensure proper relative humidity range for my 3Node server farm?

For a small farm set up, you could simply keep your normal air conditioner system and it should be fine. For large set up, you need to take into account the power consumption of your servers and turn it into BTU consumption. The quick equation to know the total BTU needed per ThreeFold Farm is:

> Server Power in kW * 3413 * Number of Servers = Total BTU

The total BTU will indicate the minimum number to look for when buying your air conditioner. For more information, read the section [Calculate the Minimum BTU Needed](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#calculate-the-minimum-btu-needed-for-the-ac) in the Farming Guide.

***

### How can I ensure the relative humidity in my server room stays within a proper range?

Look in your server's user manual to know the proper range of relative humidity your server can handle. If necessary, use an hygrometer to measure relative humidity and make sure it stays within an acceptable range for your 3Nodes. 

Depending on your geographical location and your current situation, it could be interesting to consider having a AC unit equipped with a dehumidifier. Read your servers' manual to check the proper relative humidity range and set the unit accordingly.

***

### How can I ensure the air changes per hour is optimal in the 3Node servers' room?

If deemed necessary, it is recommended to ventilate the server room in other to disperse or evacuate heat from the place. In those cases, ventilation flow will be set depending on the air changes per hour (ACPH) needed. Note that the [ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62-2001/62-2001_Addendum-n.pdf) recommends from 10 to 15 ACPH for a computer room.

***

### What are the maximum and minimum temperatures or humidity levels a 3Node server can handle?

This will depend on the specific server/computer you are using. You should check the server's technical guide/manual to get the proper information.

We will use here the Dell R720 as an example since it is a popular 3Node choice. In this case, the [Technical Guide](https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720_reference-guide_en-us.pdf).

For the R720, between 35˚C and 40˚C (or 95˚F and 104˚F), with 5% to 85% relative humidity, you can have this <10% of annual operating hours (around 36 days per year), and between 40˚C and 45˚C (or 104˚F and 113˚F), with 5 to 90% relative humidity, it’s <1% of annual operating hours (around 3.6 day per year). All this considers that there is no direct sunlight.

From 10˚C to 35˚C (thus from 50˚F to 95˚F), it’s considered standard operating temperature. With relative humidity from 10% to 80%.

This can give you a good idea of the conditions a 3Node can handle, but make sure you verify with your specific server's manual.

***

### Can the Titan 3Node be run on PoE? (Power Over Ethernet)

Titans don't come equipped for Power Over Ethernet (PoE). If you have a NUC based Titan there are some PoE lids that might be compatible.

***

### What is the relationship between the 3Node's resources and bandwidth?

A 3Node connects to the ThreeFold Grid and transfers information, whether it is in the form of compute, storage or network units (CU, SU, NU respectively). The more resources your 3Nodes offer to the Grid, the more bandwidth will be needed to transfer the additional information. 

***
### What is the bandwidth needed when it comes to running 3Nodes on the Grid?

The strict minimum for one Titan is 1 mbps of bandwidth.

If you want to expand your ThreeFold farm, you should check the following to make sure your bandwidth will be sufficient when there will be Grid utilization.

> min Bandwidth per 3Node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)

This equation means that for each TB of HDD you need 5 mbps of bandwidth, and for each TB of SSD, 8 Threads and 64GB of RAM (whichever is higher), you need 10 mbps of bandwidth. 

This means a proper bandwidth for a Titan would be 10 mbps. As stated, 1 mbps is the strict minimum for one Titan.

The bandwidth needed for a given 3Node is not yet set in stone and you are welcome to participate in ongoing the [discussion on this subject](https://forum.threefold.io/t/storage-bandwidth-ratio/1389) on the Forum.

***

### Can I run Zero-OS on a virtual machine?

You can. But you won't farm TFT. To farm TFT, Zero-OS needs to be on bare metal.
***

### Is it possible to build a DIY 3Node with VMWare VM ?

It wouldn't be possible to get farming rewards from such configuration. You need to run a 3Node Zero-OS on bare metal and no virtual machine is permitted. Indeed, to farm TFT you need bare metal. Virtual Machine will not work. Furthermore, all disks of a 3Node need to be wiped completely, thus no other OS can be on the 3Node.

It would be possible to simply set Zero-OS as a VM on VMWare VM, but it wouldn't farm as stated.

***
### Can I run a 3Node on another operating system, like Windows, MAC or Linux?

No. ThreeFold runs its own operating system (OS), which is Zero-OS. You thus need to start with completely wiped disks.
***
### What is the minimum SSD requirement for a 3Node server to farm ThreeFold tokens (TFT)?

You need a theoretical minimum of 500 GB SSD on a desktop or server. Less could work. 

***

### Is it possible to have a 3Node server running on only HDD disks?

This is not possible. A 3Node needs at least one SSD disk of 500 GB.

***

## Building a 3Node - Steps and Details

### What are the main steps to build a DIY 3Node, from start to finish?

The main steps to build a DIY 3Node are the following:

1. Create a ThreeFold farm
2. Create a Zero-OS bootstrap image
3. Set the hardware
4. Wipe all the disks
5. Set the BIOS/UEFI 
6. Boot the 3Node

For a complete step-by-step guide on how to build a DIY 3Node, read the [Farming documentation](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md).

***

### I wonder what type of desktop computer or server to use for my 3Node. Are there any recommendation when it comes to DIY 3Node hardware?

The Farming documentation contains a list of typical DIY 3Nodes in the section [List of Common DIY 3Nodes](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#list-of-common-diy-3nodes).

Also, a good place to start is by checking [what other farmers have built](https://forum.threefold.io/t/lets-share-our-farming-setup/286).

***

### What can you do to zero out your disks? How can I wipe the disks of my 3Node server with Linux?

For zero out disks unix has a tool called “wipefs”. Every distribution should have it. So if you take an ISO image of any Linux distribution and boot in “Try” mode, you can then go in a terminal or shell and write the following command:

Wipe all the disks in the 3Node:

```
sudo for i in /dev/sd*; do wipefs -a $i; done
```

Wipe all the nvme disks in the 3Node:

```
sudo for i in /dev/nvme*; do wipefs -a $i; done
```

This will wipe all of the disk devices in the hardware. Make sure you have SU permissions (write "sudo" before the command line). If needed, do a backup of the disks information before.

For more information, read the section [Wipe All the Disks](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#4-wipe-all-the-disks) of the Farming Guide.

***

### How can I wipe a disk with Windows?

Follow these simple steps:

1. Open up the command line. 
2. Write *diskpart*
3. Write *list disk*
4. Write *select disk x* (replace x with the disk you want to wipe)
5. Write *clean*

You're done! Note: do not format the disk.

### Do I need to wipe all the disks on my 3Node server? Can I have one disk with a different operating systesm (OS)?

Zero-OS will not boot properly if not all disks are wiped. All disks must be wiped. So for example, you can't have one SSD disk wiped and another one SSD with Windows OS on it. In this case, Zero-OS won't boot. You can only have one operating system (OS), Zero-OS, when running a 3Node server.

***

### How can I be sure that I properly wiped my disks?

A wiped disk has:
- no label
- no partition
- no filesystem
- only zeroes

On Linux to see if the disk is only composed of zeroes, use the command line (example with disk sda):

> cmp /dev/sda /dev/zero

If there is only zeroes, you should get the output:

> cmp: EOF on /dev/sda

You can also use the command line:

> sudo pv /dev/sda | od | head

Here are some useful command lines for Linux to make sure there are no partitions, no labels, no filesystems and that the disks are filled with zeroes only:

> sudo fdisk -l
> 
> sudo fdisk -lf
> 
> sudo parted -l
> 
> sudo parted /dev/sda 'print’
> 
> lsblk --f
> 
> lsblk --raw

***

### If I wipe my disk to create a new node ID, will I lose my farming rewards during the month?

No, you wouldn't lose any farming rewards. You will get both the rewards for your previous node ID's uptime and also the new node ID's uptime.

Note that this is the case with the current farming rewards based on total uptime, without any minimum threshold.

***

### My disks have issues with Zero-OS and my 3Nodes. How can I do a factory reset of the disks?

> Warning: this is destructive. It erases the disk sda in this example. 

Boot a Linux in Try mode and run the following command:

> sudo badblocks -svw -b 512 -t 0x00 /dev/sda

*In this example, the disk selected is sda. Choose the proper disk name in your current situation, e.g. sdb, sdc..).

This line will read and (over)write zeroes (0x00) everywhere on the disk.

To understand the line of code, note that 512 is the block size and that without -b BLOCKSIZE, the process would simply go slower.
0x00 represents the zero byte. 



This will take some time, but it should reset the disk and hopefully fix any issues.

Note: it takes the 3Node server around 1 percentage per minute for a 2TB SSD disk to accomplish the badblock operation.

***

### Before doing a bootstrap image, I need to format my USB key. How can I format my USB key?

*Note that BalenaEtcher will format and burn your bootstrap image in the same process. See next Q+A for more details.

Windows: This is done easily with diskpart. Here's all the coding needed (with disk X as an example, make sure you choose the correct disk): run Command Prompt as an administrator (right-click option), write *diskpart*, then in diskpart write *list disk*, choose your disk and write *select disk X*, write *clean*, write *create partition primary*, write *format fs=fat32*, then write *assign*. If for any reason, the process doesn't work, quit diskpart and redo the whole thing. This should fix any bug. Cautious with diskpart, it's destructive.

MAC: This is done easily with Disk Utility. Go in Disk Utility. Select your USB key, click on *erase* on the top, write a name for your USB key, then choose a format (MS-DOS (FAT) if USB key < 32GB, exFAT if USB key > 32GB), then click *erase*, then click *done*.

LINUX: In the Terminal, write *df*, find your disk (here we use sdX), write *sudo umount /dev/sdX*, write this line (with the proper FORMAT) *sudo mkfs.FORMAT /dev/sdX* [FORMAT= vfat for FAT32, ntfs for NTFS, exfat for exFAT], then finally verify the formatting by writing *sudo fsck /dev/sdX*.
***
### What do you use to burn (or to load) the Zero-OS bootstrap image onto a USB stick?

For MAC, Linux and Windows, you can use [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to load/flash the image on a USB stick. This program also formats the USB in the process. Rufus can also be used for Windows.

Also, got Linux systems, you can transfer the dowloaded image with the dd command: *dd if=created_boot_loader_file.img of=/dev/sd?* where the input file is the downloaded file from http:/bootloader.grid.tf and the output file (device) is the USB stick device. Read more [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-wipefs-to-wipe-a-signature-from-disk-on-linux/).

***
### Should I do a UEFI image or a BIOS image to bootstrap Zero-OS?

It depends on your 3Node's system. Newer computers and servers will accept UEFI. If it does not work with UEFI, please try with the options ISO (BIOS CD/DVD) or USB (BIOS image) on the [ThreeFold bootstrap website](https://bootstrap.grid.tf). Read the next Q+A for more information on BIOS/UEFI.

***

### How do I set the BIOS or UEFI of my 3Node?

You can read this [documentation](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#5-set-the-biosuefi) to learn more about BIOS and UEFI settings for a DIY 3Node.

***

### For my 3Node server, do I need to enable virtualization in BIOS or UEFI?

Yes, you should enable virtualization. On Intel, it is denoted as *CPU virtualization* and on ASUS, it is denoted as *SVM*. Make sure virtualization is enabled and look for the precise terms in your specific BIOS/UEFI.

***

### How can I boot a 3Node server with a Zero-OS bootstrap image?

Plug the USB key containing the Zero-OS bootstrap image with your farm ID then power on your 3Node. If the BIOS/UEFI is set correctly and the disks are all wiped, it should boot correctly the first time. If you have any problem booting your 3Node, read the section [Troubleshooting and Error Messages](#troubleshooting-and-error-messages) of the FAQ.

***

### The first time I booted my 3Node server, it says that the node is not registered yet. What can I do?

The first time you boot a 3Node, it will be written: “This node is not registered (farmer *: NameOfFarm). This is normal. The Grid will create a node ID and you will be able to see it on screen. This can take a couple of minutes. 

If after some time (couple hours), the 3Node doesn't get registered, there might be something off with the Grid connection. You can then try to reboot the 3Node, or wait and boot it later. If it persists, you can check the rest of the Troubleshooting section of the Farmer FAQ, or ask around the ThreeFold Telegram Farmer chat or the ThreeFold chat for help.

***

### The first time I boot my 3Node, the node gets registered but it says cache disk : no ssd. What can I do?

This probably means that you either haven't connected a SSD or that you need to wipe your SSD disk(s). Zero-OS runs on bare metal and needs a minimum of one SSD disk (min 500GB & 50 GB per CU). You will see "cache disk : OK" when it works.

***

### The first time I boot my 3 node, the node gets registered and it says cache disk : OK, but the table System Used Capacity is empty. What can I do?

Most of the time, just wait and data will appear. If you want to be sure your 3Node is online on the Grid, you can check the [Explorer](https://explorerv3.grid.tf/), which fetch information every 2 hours. If it persist, first try to simply reboot your 3Node.

***

### I have a relatively old server (e.g. Dell R710 or R620, Z840). I have trouble booting Zero-OS. What could I do?

Sometimes, Zero-OS will not boot in UEFI mode on older servers. In that case, try to boot in BIOS mode. Use either a USB key or the CD/DVD optical drive (the 4th and 5th option on https://bootstrap.grid.tf/) and make sure to select BIOS and not UEFI mode in your server settings. 
***

### I connected a SATA SSD to a CD-DVD optical drive adaptor. My system does not recognize the disk. What can I do?

Try to set AHCI mode instead of Legacy mode in SATA settings in the BIOS.

***
### Can someone explain what should I put in the Public IP part of my farm? Should I just insert my Public IP and Gateway (given by my ISP)?

Assuming you are a DIY farmer and operate from your home, this field can be left blank. You do not have to fill in any details. 

The add IP option is for farmers that have a block of IP addresses routed to their router (in data centers mostly) and want to present “dedicated IP” addresses for deployments. For more information on how to set the public configuration, go to [this link](https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__public_config).

## Farming Optimization

### What is the difference between a ThreeFold 3Node and a ThreeFold farm? What is the difference between the farm ID and the node ID?

A farm is a composition of one or many 3Nodes. A 3Node is a computer connected to the ThreeFold Grid. Each farm has its farm ID and each 3Node has its node ID.

***

### How can I know how many GB of SSD and RAM do I need?

You need 50 GB of SSD per compute units (CU) and a minimum of 500 GB SSD and 2 GB of RAM per 3Node.

A 3Node has, in general, 2 compute units (CU) per thread. Thus, for peak optimisation, you need 100 GB SSD and 8GB RAM per thread.
***
### What is the optimal ratio of virtual cores (vcores or threads), SSD storage and RAM memory? What is the best optimization scenario for a 3Node, in terms of ThreeFold tokens (TFT) farming rewards?

In short, for peak optimization, aim for 100 GB SSD of storage and 8GB RAM of memory per virtual core (vcore or thread).

For example, a 32 threads (32 vcores) 3Nodes would need 3.2 TB SSD and 256GB RAM to be optimal, reward-wise. 
That is: 32 * 100 = 3200 GB SSD = 3.2TB SSD, and 32 * 8 = 256 GB RAM total.

Adding more GB of RAM would not increase your TFT rewards. You would need more vcores if you want to expand.

NB: This is purely based on reward considerations. Some users might need different ratios for different specific uses of the Grid.

***

### What does TBW mean? What is a good TBW level for a SSD disk?

TBW means Terabytes Written. TBW directly measures how much you can write cumulatively into the drive over its lifetime. For your 3Node, it can be a good idea to prioritize a minimum ratio of 500 TBW per 1TB for SSD. 

*Note that TBW is not a technical specification, but a general claim from the manufacturer. For this reason, it can also be good to check the warranty of the disk. For example, if a manufacturer offers a 5-year warranty to its product, it indicates that the company thinks its product will last a long time.

***
### Do I need a surge protector?

A surge protector is highly recommended for your farm and your 3Nodes. This ensures your 3Nodes will not overcharge if a power surge happens. Whole-house surge protectors are also an option.
***
### Do I need a power distribution unit (PDU)?

A PDU (power distribution unit) is useful in big server settings in order to manage your wattage and keep track of your power consumption.

***
### Do I need an uninterrupted power supply (UPS)?

A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) is great for a 3Node if your power goes on and off frequently for short periods of time. This ensures your 3Node does not need to constantly reboot. If your electricity provider is very reliable, a UPS might not be needed, as the small downtime resulting from rare power outages with not exceed the DIY downtime limit*. (95% uptime, 5% downtime = 36 hours per month.)

*That being said, make sure to have settings such as AC Recovery Power set properly so your 3Node goes back online if the power shutdowns momentarily. UPS are generally used in data center to make sure people have enough time to do a "graceful" shutdown of the units when power goes off. (See next question)

***

### Are SATA and SAS drives interchangeable?

This goes only one way. You can put a SATA drive in a SAS slot, but you can’t put a SAS drive in a SATA slot. See the [next question](#what-is-the-speed-difference-between-sas-and-sata-disks) for more information.

***
### What is the speed difference between SAS and SATA disks?

One of the big differences between SATA and SAS is the transfer speed. Using SATA disks with SAS cables, you will be limited by the SATA transfer speed.

* Sata I : 150 MB/s
* Sata II : 300 MB/s
* Sata III : 600 MB/s
* SAS : 600-1500 MB/s

Note: You will most probably need to re-flash the raid card if you use the front panel disks (onboard storage) of your server.


***

### Is it possible to do a graceful shutdown to a 3Node server? How can you shutdown or power off a 3Node server? 

There are no "graceful" shutdowns of 3Nodes. You can shutdown a 3Node from the software side. You need to shut it down manually directly on the hardware. 3Nodes are self-healing and if they suddenly power down, no data or information will be lost. 

***


### Is it possible to have direct access to Zero-OS's core to force a reboot?

No, this is not possible. The general philosophy with Zero-OS is: no shell, no GUI, and no remote control. In other words, anything that could potentially provide attack surface is off the table. This ensures a high security level to Zero-OS and the ThreeFold Grid in general. To reboot a 3Node, you have to do it manually.

***

### Do I need some port forwarding in my router for each 3Node server?

No, this is not needed.


***

### Are 3Node servers noisy? Are there certain servers that are less noisy than others? 

The noises from a server can be similar to the noise of a conventional pedestal fan. As a general rule, the bigger the server, the bigger the fans (which are mostly the source of sounds). Smaller fans need to spin faster to disperse as much heat as bigger fans. So, for example, 1U servers are noisier than 2U servers. Also, note that in general, tower servers are quieter than rack servers. Go for a tower server or desktop if you want a quieter 3Node.

It has been stated that Dell servers are quieter than HP. For Dell, R710-R720 are quieter than Compellent. You can check the server's manual and see directly the noise they produce in decibels.

Note that servers generate *white noise*. White noise is often used for sound masking. For some, it helps them to relax and to fall asleep. A server in your bedroom, why not?

***

### Are there ways to reduce 3Node servers' noises?

To reduce the noise, you can remove all the unnecessary cards in the servers as well as the HDD disks if you don't use them. Unplugging the SAS cables can also help. You can also set the fans to adjust their speed instead of being constant.

At the end of the day, servers were manufactured for durability and efficiency, and not for being quiet. Most servers are placed in server rooms where noise doesn't matter much.

***


### What is the difference between the two CPUs: i7-6700 and i7-6700T?

The T stands for thermal throttled. The i7-6700T is 46% more energy efficient. While the i7-6700 has a 42% faster CPU speed and has a higher passmark. Note that the TFT reward is going to be the same. The difference is with power consumption: 35 Watt for the i7-6700t and 65 Watt for the i7-6700.

For a more thorough comparison, read [this](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-6700T-vs-Intel-Core-i7-6700/m36439vs3515).

***


### I built a 3Node out of old hardware. Is it possible that my BIOS or UEFI has improper time and date set as factory default?

Yes. Make sure you have the correct time and date in BIOS to avoid errors when trying to boot Zero-OS. It might not cause any problems, but sometimes it does. 

***

### I have rack servers in my ThreeFold farm. Can I set rack servers vertically?

In general, it is not recommended to set rack servers vertically as they were designed to be laid flat in racks. That being said, if you want to set your rack vertically, here are some general rules to follow. Do so at your own risk. 

First, make sure the parts in the servers are well installed and that they will not fall if laid vertically. Second, and foremost, you want to make sure that there will not be any overheating. This means to make sure you don't block the front and rear of the unit, so heat can dissipate thought the vents.

If you want to put the rack vertically with the longest side of the rack laying upward, having the power supply units (PSUs) on the very top will ensure that heat dissipate well. 

***


## Farming and Maintenance

### Do I need the Zero-OS bootstrap image drive (USB or CD-DVD) when I reboot, or can I boot Zero-OS from the 3Node main hard drive?

It is advised to keep the bootstrap image plugged in your 3Node. Once your node has been booted with Zero-OS via the USB key, you can remove the USB key, but if something happens and the node needs to reconnect with the network, it won’t be able to do so. We advise people to let the USB key always in so the node can reconnect with the network if needed.

You need the bootstrap image device plugged in every time you reboot a 3Node and it's a good practice to keep it plugged in all the time. The technical explanation is: (1) at first boot, it creates a minimum requirement on SSD which is used as cache (2) each time the system restarts it reuses this SSD piece but Zero-OS bootstrap is also needed to download the last image. Indeed, image is not stored on the machine and also no boot loader is installed.

***

### When I set my farm on the ThreeFold Dashboard with polkadot.js, it asks for a Stellar payout address. What should I write?

The easiest method would be to write the address on your ThreeFold Connect App. You can also write any address that is on the Stellar blockchain and has a trustline enabled with ThreeFold Token.
***
### It's written that my node is using 100% of HRU. What does it mean?

HRU stands for your HDD space available. It means that you are using 100% of the HDD space available, or equivalently that you have no HDD on your system.

***
### On the ThreeFold Explorer, I only see half of the virtual cores or threads my 3Node has, what can I do?

Check in the BIOS settings and make sure you have enabled Virtual Cores (or Hyper Threading/Logical Cores).

***

### What is the current status on the Wake-on-LAN (WOL) feature?

The WOL feature has been revised. This project has transformed into the Farmerbot. The farmer bot is a piece of software that can run as a grid deployment and manages a farmers nodes.

To learn more about the Farmerbot, read the [Farmerbot Guide](../farmerbot/farmerbot.md).

***

### Why are the 3Nodes' resources different on the ThreeFold Explorer and the ThreeFold Dashboard?

There is a difference because one shows the resources in GiB and the other in GB. It's just a way to display information, the resources are ultimately the same, but shown differently. 1 GiB = 1.073741824 GB.


***
### What do CRU, MRU, HRU and SRU mean on the ThreeFold Explorer?

CRU means the number of virtual cores. MRU means the GB of ram (memory). HRU means the HDD capacity storage and SRU means the SSD capacity storage.

***

### I have more than one ThreeFold 3Node farm, but I want all my 3Nodes on only one farm. How can I put all my 3Nodes on one farm? How can I change the farm ID of my 3Node?

If you have more than one 3Node associated with more than one farm, it is possible to put all the 3Nodes under only one farm.
The following shows how to change the farm ID of your 3Node.

For each 3Node, you need to create a new USB key Zero-OS boostrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. This will ensure your 3Node links to the chosen farm.
To create a new USB key Zero-OS bootstrap image, you can download the bootstrap image [here](https://v3.bootstrap.grid.tf/) or you can clone an existing USB key bootstrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. In both case, you can use a software like [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
Once you have the new USB key bootstrap image, plug it into the 3Node and reboot the server.
After reboot, the 3Node will have the same node ID as before, but it will now be associated with the chosen farm ID.

Note: If you want a new node ID for your 3Node, you will need to wipe the main SSD of your 3Node.

***

### How can I know if my 3Node is online on the Grid? Is there an Explorer for Grid V3?

There are multiple answers to this.

(1) You can plug a monitor to your 3Node and check directly its status. 

(2) You can check your 3Node status by using the Explorer of the [ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/).

(3) You can also use the unofficial, but highly useful [ThreeFold Node Status Bot](https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot) on Telegram. 

***

### I booted my 3Node and the monitor says it's online and connected to the Grid. But the ThreeFold Explorer says it is offline? What can I do?

The Explorer refetches information every 2 hours. You can wait 2 hours and see if the problem persists. Then/or, you could reboot the 3Node and see if the Explorer sees it as online. 

***

### My 3Node does show on the ThreeFold Explorer, but not on the ThreeFold Dashboard, what can I do?

If you're 3Node is correctly registered on the ThreeFold Grid but you cannot see it on the ThreeFold Dashboard, there can be many different ways to solve this issue.

One way to fix this is to go in the TF Dashboard, select *change the address* and then simply re-paste the same address, then the extension will ask you to resign. Usually this fixes the issue.

If the first method did not work, you can try to remove the account and add it back up on the Polkadot.js extension. Before doing so, make sure you have a back up of your seed phrase as you will need it to re-enter the account. Your 3Node should then appear.

***

### I set up my farm on ThreeFold Connect App. Can I use the Polkadot extension Dashboard instead?


If you want to use the Dashboard, you can take the TFChain Secret from the app and import it into the Polkadot extension. For more information, read [this section](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#move-farm-from-the-tf-app-to-the-tf-portal-polkadotjs) of the Farming Guide. For the other way around (TF Dashboad to TF Connect App), read [this section](../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.md#import-tf-portal-polkadotjs-wallet-to-the-tf-connect-app-wallet) of the guide.

***

 
### Is it equivalent to create a farm on ThreeFold Connect App or via the Polkadot extension?

Yes it is. Farm setup through the app and using the Polkadot extension with the Dashboard are equivalent. 

***

### If I upgrade my 3Node, will it increase my rewards?

Yes. Use the simulator.grid.tf to verify the additional rewards. But note that, currently, upgrades are not recognized until the next minting cycle.
***

### I booted my 3Node for the first time at the beginning of the month, then I did some upgrade or downgrade, will the ThreeFold Grid recognize the new hardware? Will it still be the same 3Node ID?

Downgrades are counted in the current minting cycle. So you mint for the entire cycle at the downgraded specs.

Minting only considers a single configuration per node per cycle, and that is the minimum configuration seen at any point during the cycle. With this logic in mind, upgrades will only be recognized at the next minting cycle. Note that your 3Node will have a new ID and new price entry if you changed the SSD containing the 3Node ID.



***


### Is it possible to ask the 3Node to refetch the node information on the monitor?

To refetch information, press " q " on the keyboard.

***

### When does Zero-OS detect the capacity of a 3Node?

Zero-OS only detects capacity right after it boots.



***
### Where is the 3Node ID stored?

For the current Zero-OS version, the node ID is stored in the first SSD you install on your 3Node*. If you change or erase this disk, this disk will lose its current 3Node ID.

*Note that if, at the first boot, you put a SSD SATA and a SSD NVME at the same time, the node ID will be registered on the SSD SATA.


***

### Is there a way to backup my node ID in order to restore a 3Node if the disk with the node ID gets corrupted or breaks down?

Yes, you can do a backup, but as of now this process must be done manually. 

One way is to boot a Linux USB image in *Try* mode, open up the *File* folder of your disk that contains the node ID. Click on *+ Other Locations.* Then, open the folder that contains the folder *zos-cache* and open the folder *identityd.* In this folder, select the file *seed.txt* and make a copy of it in a safe place (USB key, notebook, e-mail, etc.). If the disk which contains your node ID is damaged, simply reboot the 3Node with a new disk and the Zero-OS bootstrap image. Your 3Node will connect to the Grid and assign a new node ID. Once this is done, reboot the 3Node, but this time with the Linux USB image, go in the same folder as stated before and replace the new *seed.txt* file with the old file. Reboot your 3Node with the Zero-OS bootstrap and you're done.

***

### If I upgrade my 3Node, does it change the node ID?

Upgrades won't change the node ID, unless you replace the SSD where the node ID is stored (see above for more info on this). 


***

### Does it make sense to recreate my node when the price drops?

Short answer: no. Long answer: [click here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/does-it-make-sense-to-recreate-my-node-when-the-price-drops/).

***
### My 3Node lost power momentarily and I had to power it back on manually. Is there a better way to proceed?

In your BIOS, go in *Security Settings* and choose *Last* for *AC Power Recovery*. If you want, set a delay between 60 and 240 seconds. This will ensure your 3Node does not power on and off frantically if your power flickers on and off, thus potentially damaging the unit. On other BIOS, it's *After Power Loss*, and you should choose *Previous State*.

*Depending on your 3Node, the parameter might have a different name.

***
### Do I need to change the battery BIOS?

It can be a good thing to change it when you buy an old desktop or server to make sure it lasts long. When the battery goes out of power, the 3Node won't have access to the BIOS settings if it loses power momentarily.

***

### Do I need to enable UEFI Network Stack?

You don't need to if you use a removable media (e.g. USB key) as a booting image. It is needed only if you boot from a PXE server on your network. You should keep this feature disabled. Enable it only if you know 100% what you are doing. Otherwise it might bring vulnerabilities in terms of network security.

***
### I want redundancy of power for my 3 nodes. I have two PSU on my Dell server. What can I do?

Make sure you enable the Hot Spare feature. This feature is accessible in iDRAC Settings - Power Configuration. Other servers might have this function, with a different name and configuration. Check the server's manual for more details.

***

### Why isn't there support for RAID? Does Zero-OS work with RAID?

RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that we at ThreeFold did not want to get stuck in. We developed a different (and more efficient way to store data reliably. Please have a look [here](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__cloud_products?id=storage-quantum-safe-filesystem).

This Quantum Safe Storage overcomes some of the shortfalls of RAID and is able to work over multiple nodes geographically spread on the TF Grid. 

***
### Is there a way to bypass RAID in order for Zero-OS to have bare metals on the system? (No RAID controller in between storage and the Grid.)

Yes it is possible. "You can use the on board storage on a server without RAID. You can [re-flash](https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html)  the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. No need for RAID." @FLnelson It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw)) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.

***

### I have a 3Node rack server. Is it possible to use a M.2 to SATA adapter in order to put the M.2 SATA disk in the HDD bay (onboard storage)?

Yes, it is possible. You will most probably need to bypass the RAID controller for Zero-OS to access properly the onboard storage. See previous question.

***

### My 3Node uses only PCIe adapters and SSD NVME disks. Do I need the RAID controller on? 

The onboard RAID controller is not linked to your PCIe SSDs. In this case, you can switch the RAID controller off.


***

### Can I change the name of my farm on polkadot.js?

It’s possible to rename farms through the Polkadot UI. For mainnet, use [this link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/extrinsics).

1. Under *using the selected account*, select the account that owns the farm
2. Choose *tfgridModule* from the dropdown menu *submit the following extrinsic*, 
3. Select *updateFarm(id, name, pricingPolicyId)*
4. Under *name: Bytes*, write the new farm name
5. Finally, click on the bottom *Submit Transaction* at the bottom right of the screen

***

### How can I delete a farm on polkadot.js?

The ability to delete a farm was removed from TF Chain due to concerns that nodes could be left without a farm and thus cause problems with billing.

***

### I try to delete a node on the TF Dashboard, but it doesn’t work. Is there any other way to proceed that could work?

It’s possible to delete nodes through the Polkadot UI. For mainnet, use [this link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/extrinsics).

1. Under *using the selected account*, select the account that owns the farm, 
2. Choose *tfgridModule* from the dropdown menu *submit the following extrinsic*
3. Select *deleteNodeFarm(nodeId)*
4. Under *id: u32*, write the ID of the 3Node you want to delete
5. Finally, click on the bottom *Submit Transaction* at the bottom right of the screen

### My 3Node has 2 ethernet ports in the back, with one written AMT above, what does it mean? Can I use this port to connect my 3Node to the ThreeFold Grid?

First, let's define the term AMT. It means: Active Management Technology. Without going into too much details, it is to remotely access servers via the network at the BIOS level. Thus, you should plug the ethernet cable in the port next to AMT, and not into the AMT port. You can explore AMT properties if you want remote access to your server.

### My 3Node is based on a the hardware Z600, Z620 or Z820, can I run it headless or without a GPU?

For the Z600, there is a great [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=JgBYbaT-N-w).

For the Z620 and the Z820, you need to do some variation on the video above. In the BIOS, go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Save to Removable Storage Device. This will save a text file on your USB key. Then, in the text file, go to Headless Mode and remove the * in front of Disable and put it in front of Enable. Save the file and then go back into BIOS. Now go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Restore from Removable Storage Device.

Running your 3Node without the GPU can save some power consumption as well as giving you one more extra slot for other hardware.
***

### My 3Node is based on a Z800. The PSU is not working anymore. Is there an alternative to buying another expensive PSU?

It is possible to build your own PSU for the Z800. There is a great DIY guide by Linus on this [here](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1134357-hp-z800-alternative-power-supply-found/). This is clearly for advanced DIYer.

***

### Is it possible to add high-level GPU on rack servers to farm more TFT?

Some farmers had success installing GPUs such as the RTX3080 in servers as small as 2U (such as R730). Connections such as 250W 8-pin plug are needed on each riser. Generally, tower servers have more space to add high-level GPU.

Note: GPU farming will be implemented in the future.

***

### If I change farm, will my node IDs change on my 3Node servers?

You can move 3Nodes between farms without losing the node IDs. You simply need to change the boot media with the new farm ID and then reboot the 3Node. The 3Node will have the same node ID but it will now be associated with the new farm ID.

***
## Troubleshooting and Error Messages

### Is it possible to access the Error Screen or Log Screen?

Yes! On the Zero-OS console, hit alt-F2 to open up the Error/Log Screen, and hit alt-F3 to go back to the main screen. 

***

### I plugged an HDMI cable from my monitor into the node and the monitor is displaying nothing. What can I do?

You may have to reboot with HDMI cable already connected. Video does not seem to be turned on unless HDMI is present at boot. Once you boot with HDMI in, you can unplug and replug and it will work.

To simply see if your 3Node is online, you can go on the [ThreeFold Explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io) or check with the [Telegram ThreeFold Farm Status Bot](https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot).
***

### What does it mean when I see, during the 3Node boot, the message: error = context deadline exceeded?

In general, this message means that the ThreeFold Grid asked something to your 3Node, and your 3Node could not respond fast enough. It is usually necessary to read the following error message to understand the situation more specifically.
***

### I try to boot a 3Node, but I get the error No Route to Host on Linux. What does it mean?

There are many potential answers to this. Perhaps the Host is offline, the service isn't running. This is usually the reason with TF Grid. It means the Grid is not responsive. In this case, try to boot the 3Node later. If it persists ask TF Support.

There can also be other reasons. You might have connected to the wrong port. Perhaps you have configured iptables to block connections on that port. Your DNS might be improperly configured. You might have an Incorrect Network or Host Configuration. Many troubleshoots are possible. Here's a [good place to start](https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-no-route-to-host-error-linux/).

***

### When booting a 3Node, I get the message: failed to register node: failed to create node: failed to submit extrinsic: Invalid Transaction: registration failed. What could fix this?

The most probable fix to this error is simply to properly wipe your disk(s):

* [Wipe your disks on Linux](#what-can-you-do-to-zero-out-your-disks-how-can-i-wipe-the-disks-of-my-3node-server-with-linux)

* [Wipe your disks on Windows](#how-can-i-wipe-a-disk-with-windows)

***
### I try to boot a 3Node, but I get the message no route with default gateway found. What does it mean?

First, let's see the main terms. Default gateway act as an access point to other networks, in this case the TF Grid, when there is a back and forth exchange of data packets.

While the last question implied a communication problem from the Grid, this error message usually means that the 3Node has communication problem. In short, it has difficulty reaching the TF Grid. There are many ways to troubleshoot this error. First, let's give the most direct solution. Make sure you have a direct connection with your Internet Service Provider (ISP): your 3Node should be connected to a router or a switcher via an ethernet cable. Wifi doesn't work. Make sure your DHCP is set correctly.

If the problem persists, check the default gateway of your 3Node and then make sure your router can reach it. 

*See next Q+A for more a possible solution.

***

### I have trouble connecting the 3Node to the Grid with a 10GB NIC card. What can I do?

As of now, Zero-OS sometimes has trouble with 10GB NIC card. The easiest solution to this is to connect your 3Node with the 1GB NIC card. This should solve the issue. More fine tuning might be needed to get your 3Node to work with a 10GB NIC card. Future Zero-OS version might solve this issue.

***

### I switch the ethernet cable to a different port when my 3Node was running. Internet connection is lost. What can I do?

When your 3Node boots, Zero-OS marks the NIC port. This means you cannot change NIC port when your 3Node is running. You can either put back the ethernet cable in the initial NIC port, or reboot the 3Node. At boot, Zero-OS will marks the new NIC port as the main entry.

***

### I  get the error Certificate is not yet valid when booting my 3Node server, what can I do?

Make sure your firmware is up to date. If necessary, reinstall it. You might have to install then re-install the firmware if your system is very old. 

***

### I tried to wipe my disk, but I get the error Probing Initialized Failed. What can I do?

Some people tried the command *wipefs -a /dev/sd without success. (Where * is the specific disk letter.) When you get that error, sometimes it is because your are trying to wipe your boot USB by accident. If this is not the case, and you really are trying to wipe your disk, try this command *wipefs -af /dev/sd.

***

### I did a format on my SSD disk, but Zero-OS still does not recognize them. What's wrong?

Formatting is one thing, but to boot properly, Zero-OS needs to work on a completely wipe disk. Thus, make sure you [wipe your disks](#what-can-you-do-to-zero-out-your-disks-how-can-i-wipe-the-disks-with-linux). Formatting is not enough.
***


### I have a Dell Rx10 server (R610, 710, 910). When I boot Zero-OS I get the message Probing EDD and the 3Node doesn't boot from there. What can I do?

For the R610 and 710, you can simply re-flash the card. See [this link](https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html) for more information. For the 910, you can’t re-flash the card. In this case, get a LSI Dell card and it should work. (They are cheap when you buy them used online.)

***
### My 3Node doesn't boot properly without a monitor plugged in. What can I do?

First, try to disable the "Halt On" mode in BIOS. If you do not have this option, try simply enabling the Legacy Support (Dell BIOS for example). If this doesn't work, try to plug in a Dummy Plug/Headless Ghost/Display Emulator in your 3Node. This will simulate a plugged monitor. This should fix the problem.
***

### My 3Node is running on the Grid, but when I plugged in the monitor, it states: Disabling IR #16. Is there a problem?

In general, you can simply ignore this error statement. This error is linked to the Nvidia binary driver. It simply means that your 3Node lost connection with the graphic card (by unplugging and replugging the monitor for example).
***

### My 3Node won't boot without disabling the Secure Boot option, is it safe?

In the case where you want to boot Zero-OS, disabling Secure Boot option is safe. With Secure Boot disabled, it can be easier or even necessary when it comes to booting Zero-OS. Secure Boot is used when you want to lock the BIOS/UEFI settings.

***

### When I tried to boot my 3Node, at some point the screen went black, with or without a blinking hyphen or dash. What could cause this and what could I do to resolve the issue?

There is a possibility that this happens because you are booting your 3Node on a HDD. A 3Node needs a minimum of 500GB of SSD to work properly.

Also, make sure that you are using the correct boot option (Legacy BIOS or UEFI) in the Settings and that it corresponds to the correct booting image on the ThreeFold Bootstrap page.

This problem often arises when you plugged your disks in the wrong controller. For example, try unpluging the disks from the SAS controller, and plug them in the SATA controller. Also, disable the SAS controller if needed.

In a Legacy BIOS boot, make sure Legacy is enabled and disable *Data Execution Prevention* if possible.

Also, it might have to do with your RAID controller configuration. Make sure this is properly set. For example, configuring all the HDD disks into one logical disk can fix this problem, or re-flashing the RAID card can also help.

***

### My 3Nodes go offline after a modem reboot. Is there a way to prevent this?

Yes, there are many ways to prevent this. An easy solution is to set the DHCP server to reserve local IPs for the 3Nodes MAC addresses.

This problem is also preventable if your router stays online during the modem reboot. 

Indeed, rebooting the 3Nodes is necessary when there are local IP changes, as 3Nodes are addressed a local IP addresses when they are booted.

The DHCP will addresses any local IP address that is available when you are booting a 3Node. Reserving local IP addresses is a good TF farming practice.

***

### When I boot my 3Node, it reaches the Welcome to Zero-OS window, but it doesn't boot properly and there's an error message: failed to load object : type substrate..., what can I do?

Usually simply rebooting the 3Node fixes this problem.

***

### When I try to access iDRAC on a web browswer, even with protected mode off, I get the error The webpage cannot be found, what can I do?

Open iDRAC in the Internet Explorer emulator extension (IE Tab) in Chrome, then update iDRAC. It should work elsewhere then. Sometimes, it will be needed to add "ST1=code" at the end of the IE Tab url.

***

### When booting the 3Node, I get the error Network interface detected but autoconfiguration failed. What can I do?

First make sure your network cable is plugged in and that your DHCP is working and responding. If you change the NIC port of the ethernet cable, make sure to reboot the 3Node so Zero-OS can change the NIC port attribution.

Some farmers reported that this got fixed by simply powering off the 3Node(s), the router and modem for 2 minutes then powering it all back on. Resetting the modem and router (switch on the hardware) in the process can also help.

If this doesn't work, try to upgrade the firmware of the NIC and the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, the NIC card might be broken. Try with another NIC card.

***

### When I boot my Dell server, I get the message: All of the disks from your previous configuration are gone... Press any key to continue or 'C' to load the configuration utility. What can I do?

Many changes to your server can lead to this message. 

Usually, the easiest solution is to reset the disk configuration in iDRAC's configuration utility.

What can causes this message:

1. During a new installation, the cables connecting to your external storage are not wired to the correct ports.
2. Your RAID adapter has failed.
3. Your SAS cables are not plugged properly or are malfunctioning.

Note: Resetting the configuration will destroy all data on all virtual disks. Make sure you know what you are doing! In doubt, ask the TF community.

***

### I have a Dell R620. In Zero-OS, I get the failure message No network card found and then the 3Node reebots after few seconds. The same happens for every LAN input. What can I do?

The first thing to try here is to boot the server in BIOS mode instead of UEFI mode. If this doesn't fix the problem, try the following.

Sometimes, this happens when the firmwares of BIOS, iDRAC, Lifecycle Controller and NIC are incompatible to each other. The solution is then to update them all correctly. Some problems can arise in the process.

First, you should try to do the updates using iDRAC as you can update both iDRAC and BIOS there. If this does not work, try to update separate, with a live-linux distro, the BIOS, iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller. Once this is done, the server should be able to do a liveupdate, https to dell support website, via lifecycle-controller. This would update the other components. For more details on this method, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA7j2BKgjI).

Note: Some farmers have reported that the Broadcom NIC card does not work well for Zero-OS and that a standard Intel PCI NIC card replacement resolved the issue. This could be a more straightforward method if updating the firmwares doesn't resolve the issue.

***

### I am using freeDos to crossflash my raid controller on a Dell server, but I can't see the RAID controller with the Command Info. What can I do?

Turn on the raid controller in the BIOS, otherwise freeDos does not show you the raid controller with the command Info.

***

### Can I use a VGA to HDMI adaptor to connect a TV screen or monitor to the 3Node? I tried to boot a 3Node with a VGA to HDMI adaptor but the boot fails, what can I do?

This might work, but it has been reported by farmers that Zero-OS might have difficulties booting when this is done with a VGA/HDMI adaptor on a TV screen. This is most likely due to the TV screen not supporting the output once the system loaded into Zero-OS. The easy fix to this issue is to use a standard computer monitor with a VGA plug.

***

### When I try to boot my 3Node, the fans start spinning fast with a loud noise and the screen is black. What can I do to resolve this?

There may be several causes to this issue. You can try to remove all the RAM sticks, to clean the dust and then to reseat the RAM sticks. If it still doesn't resolve the issue, you can check the RAM sticks one by one to see if one is malfunctioning. This often resolves the issue. Also, some cables might not be properly connected.

***

### When booting Zero-OS with IPV6 configurations, I get the errors (1) dial tcp: address IPV6-address too many columns in address and (2) no pools matches key: not routable. What can I do to fix this issue?

This usually means that the IPV6 attributed is not valid. It is also often caused when the DNS configuration does not resolve IPV6 correctly.

To fix this issue, it is often necessary to adjust the IPV6 settings related to the router and the modem. Confirming with your Internet service provider (ISP) that the IPV6 settings are properly configured could also be necessary to fix the issue.


***

### When booting a 3Node, Zero-OS downloads fine, but then I get the message: error no route with default gateway found, and the message: info check if interface has a cable plugged in. What could fix this?

Make sure you have network stack enabled in BIOS. If so, check you ethernet port and make sure that it's clean. Also make sure the ethernet rj45 connectors are clean on both ends. If that does not work, verify the state of your SATA cables. If all this doesn't work, download and re-install Zero-OS.

***

### How can I update Dell and HP servers to Intel E5-2600v2, E5-2400v2 and E5-4600v2, when applicable?

***

### When I boot a 3Node in UEFI mode, it gets stuck at: Initializing Network Device, is there a way to fix this?

Usually, booting the 3Node in BIOS mode instead of UEFI mode fixes this issue.

***

### When I boot my 3Node, it gets stuck during the Zero-OS download. It never reaches 100%. What can I do to fix this issue?

Here are some ways to troubleshoot your 3Node when it cannot download Zero-OS completely (to 100%):

* Sometimes, just rebooting the 3Node and/or trying a little bit later can work.
* It can help to reboot the modem and the router. 
* Make sure your BIOS/UEFI is up to date. Updating the BIOS/UEFI can help. 
* It can also help to set the correct date and time.

***

### When booting a 3Node, I get the error=“context deadline exceeded” module=network error=failed to initialize rmb api failed to initialized admin mw: failed to get farm: farm not found: object not found. What can I do to fix this issue?

Usually, the simple fix to this issue is to make sure that your bootstrap image is on the same network as your farm. For example, if you created your farm on the Main net, you should use a Main net Zero-OS bootstrap image.

***

## ThreeFold Grid and Data


### How is the farming minting reward calculated? Is the Grid always monitoring my 3Node?

The Grid uses an algorithm that does not continually monitor the 3Node. It does its best to determine uptime through occasional checking in, which we call ping. The 3Node sends a ping to the Grid and the Grid sends a ping to the 3Node to confirm the reception. (Ping-Pong!)

It’s helpful to understand that the Grid is really just 3Nodes and TF Chain (which itself is a collection of nodes). Nodes report their uptime by writing an entry on TF Chain, about once every two hours. These reports are used for minting.

***

### How does communication happen on the ThreeFold Grid at the 3Node's level?

There are two ways to get information about nodes. Once is to query TF Chain, and the other is to communicate with nodes directly.

***

### What is the ThreeFold Node Status bot Telegram link?

The link is the following: https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot.

***

### How does the ThreeFold Node Status bot work? How can I use the ThreeFold Node Status bot to verify if my 3Node is online?

1. Click on this link: https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot

2. To subscribe a node, write the command */subscribe nodeID*. With the ID 100 as example, write: */subscribe 100*

3. To verify the status of all your 3Nodes, write: */status*

4. To verify the status of all your 3Nodes through Yggdrasil, write: */ping*

Note: The bot should send you alerts when it considers any registered node to be offline. 

***

### How does the Telegram Status Bot get information from my 3Node? My 3Node is online on the ThreeFold Explorer, but offline on the Telegram Status Bot, is this normal?

The status bot communicates directly by sending pings to the nodes over Yggdrasil every five minutes. Therefore, it will report on temporary network interruptions that might not affect your total uptime calculation as used for minting.

***

### I noticed that when I reboot my 3Node, the uptime counter on the ThreeFold Explorer goes back to zero. Does it mean I lose uptime and the uptime start over again when I reboot the 3Node?

No. The only uptime you lose is the time your 3Node was offline from the ThreeFold Grid. This ThreeFold Grid still has the data of your total uptime of the month. The Explorer only shows this statistics as: "*This node has been up non-stop without being rebooted for now* [insert time]". If you maintain a total uptime above the minimum uptime, you're fine.

*For now the farming rewards are proportional to the total uptime.

***
### One of my nodes is showing the wrong location. Any problem with that?
The ThreeFold Explorer is showing your ISP location. This is perfectly normal.
***

## Memory

### Can I use different type of RAM for the same 3Node?

No. Always use the same type of RAM per 3Node. If you use RDIMM, go all RDIMM, etc. Check your hardware specifications to make sure you have the right type of memory.

***

### How can I know if the memory I am buying is correct for my specific hardware?

To be sure, look into the owner's manual of your specific computer.

In general, you can go to [Memory.net](https://memory.net/) and look for your specific computer model. As general steps, select your computer's system in *By system*, then select the series and then select the specific model of the series. You will then see available memories to buy from memory.net. You can also simply read the documentation at the bottom. The memory type supported by your computer will be explained. Then you can buy the memory needed from any other computer store. 

For servers, you can check with Cloudninja's documentation [here](https://cloudninjas.com/pages/server-memory). Search for your specific hardware and look for the compatible memory. This reference is good for rack and tower servers.

***

### What do the terms RDIMM, LDIMM, UDIMM, LRDIMM, FBDIMM mean when it comes to RAM memory sticks?

Well first, the DIMM means dual inline memory module. 

* U stands for or unregistered (or unbuffered). 

* R stands for registered memory.

* LR stands for load-reduced. 

* FB stands for fully-buffered.

***

### What is the difference between ECC and non-ECC memory?

ECC means error correction code memory. This type of memory can detect and correct data corruption. Non-ECC mostly cannot detect nor correct, but some can detect, but never correct data corruption. Check your hardware specifications to make sure you have the right type of memory (ECC or non-ECC).
***

### How can I change the RAM memory sticks on my 3Nodes? How can I achieve dual channel configuration with sticks of RAM?

First, always use RAM sticks of the same size and type. It should be noted on your motherboard which slots to populate first. As a general guide, there is usually 2 slots A and B, with each 2 memory stick entries. You must then install the ram sticks on A1 and B1 in order to achieve dual channel, then A2 and B2 if you have more (visual order: A1 A2 B1 B2).

> Example: You want to start with your largest sticks, evenly distributed between both processors and work your way down to your smallest. Let's take an example with 2 processors as well as 4x 16GB sticks and 4x 8GB sticks. The arrangement would be A1-16GB, B1-16GB, A2-16GB, B2-16GB, A3-8GB, B3-8GB, A4-8GB, B4-8GB. Avoid odd numbers as well. You optimally want pairs. So if you only have 5x 8GB sticks, only install 4 until you have an even 6.

***

### What does RAM mean?

RAM means random access memory. Those type of memory can be read and changed in any order.

***


### What does DIMM mean when it comes to RAM sticks?

It means *dual in-line memory module*. This type of computer memory is natively 64 bits, enabling fast data transfer. 

***

### I have 24 DIMMS ram slots on my server. Can I use them all?

Be careful when installing memory on a server. Always check your server's documentation to make sure your RAM sticks combination are correct. 

For example, on the Dell R720, you can have 24x16gb RAM ECC sticks, but it can only handle 16 Quad ranked DIMMs. In this case, you can fill up all slots with registered DIMMs if you have a maximum of 4 quad DIMMS ranked on each CPU.

***

## Farmerbot

### Why does the farmerbot need to wake nodes up for uptime report, if they are unused and shut down?

Because we want to know that the node is still available (is still there to be used). A farmer can unplug a node at any time so we can't distinct a node that has been unplugged from a node that is off.

***

### Can a farmer opt in for farmerbot but also make exemption for certain nodes to never be shutdown regardless (for v1)? 

We could do that, but as we are in the testing phase right now, it is not a good idea. But since The farmer is already able to configure the capacity planning rule: the percentage of how much unused resources he/she wants to be available, this deemed to be unnecessary. Whenever that percentage is reached a new node is powered on.

***

### Will this feature require a master node that will never be shut down?

Yes, that is a requirement. Nodes are powered on by other nodes (WOL packet comes from one of the nodes in the farm). So if you want to be able to power them back on you have to have at least one node powered on.

***

### Concerning the turning on of offline nodes, at the end, how does a farmer decide what almost full means? What do we decide?

Nodes are powered on in two cases: when the total resource usage reaches a certain percentage (defined by the farmer) or when there is an incoming find_node request and that the selected node is off.

***

### Does the Farmerbot need to run physically in the farm?

The Farmerbot doesn’t have to run physically in the farm since it instructs nodes over RMB to shut down / power on nodes.

***

### How many Farmerbot can you run per farm?

You can run only one Farmerbot for now.

***

### On how many nodes can the Farmerbot run?

Currently you can only deploy one Farmerbot for each farm, so the Farmerbot can only run on one node.

***

### What is the uptime requirement for the Farmerbot?

The Farmerbot should be running all the time or not at all (this is up to the farmer)

***

### Can I run the Farmerbot on my farm?

Though you can run the Farmerbot anywhere you want, it doesn’t have to be on a 3Node in your farm.

***

### Can the Farmerbot be the same node that wakes the other nodes?

If you want, you can set your Farmerbot on your farm, in the same LAN as all other nodes, and designate this 3Node to be the node that wakes up the other nodes.

***

### What if I want to have several LANs with different group of 3Nodes?

You can set different farms in different LANs and set one Farmerbot per farm.

***

### Can I turn all my nodes off while the Farmerbot runs? Why do I need at least one node per farm to be powered on?

The farmer bot uses the nodes in the farm to send WOL packets to the node that needs to wakeup. For this reason, you need at least one node per farm to be powered on at all time.

***

### What type of computer can run the Farmerbot? What are the minimum specs to run the Farmerbot?
The Farmerbot can run on any computer/server, it could even run on a laptop so to speak, as long as it has an internet connection, the Farmerbot will be working fine.

The Farmerbot runs fine on a VM with a single vcore and 2GB of RAM. For the storage, you need to have room for Docker and its dependencies. Thus 1 or 2GB of free storage, with the OS already installed, should be sufficient.

***

### What happened if all the nodes are powered off?

If all nodes in a subnet are powered off, there is no way other nodes in other subnets will be able to power them on again so that is an issue.

***

### Is there a fail over setup possible for the Farmerbot?

It should be possible to set (at least) 2 instances of the Farmerbot and have a fail over setup. Stay tuned for more information on this.

***

### How do 3Nodes power on and off with the Farmerbot?

Nodes power themselves down by checking TF Chain for a new power target. They power back up by receiving the magic packet from another node in the same LAN.

***

### Can you have only one 3Node in your farm with the Farmerbot?

No. Since you need at least one node to power up a second node. you can't test the Farmerbot with just one node. You need at least two 3Nodes in your farm with the Farmerbot.

***

### Is there a way to access more error checking?

Yes. In the config-path where you run the docker-compose, you have more logging for error checking. Under the directory where you set up your Farmerbot, you have the directory “config” in there where it creates a *.log file if you start the bot via Docker-Compose. In this directory, you can search for errors if something doesn't work as expected.

***

### Do I need TFT to run the Farmerbot? How much?

Yes. How much depends on where you run the farmerbot and how many nodes it will power on/off. If you run the farmerbot on a node on the grid you will have to pay TFT to rent that node (or deploy on that node). Next to that, you will have to pay the transaction fees every time the farmerbot has to wakeup a node or shutdown a node. This is with the account tied to the twin of your farm. On average each node in the farm will be shutdown and powered on at least once a day (periodic wakeup). In that case the average cost per month to power on nodes and shut them back down equals:

> cost per month = 0.001 TFT (extrinsic fee) * amount of nodes * 30 * 2 (1 for powering down, one for powering up)

***

### On the Farmerbot, I receive the error: "Balance is not enough to apply an extrinsic". What can I do to fix this issue?

This means that you do not have sufficient funds (TFT) in your wallet for the Farmerbot's fees.

You thus simply need to add some TFTs in the wallet that is connected to the farm on which you are running the Farmerbot. 1 TFT can suffice for many transactions. 

For more information on the Farmerbot running cost, read this [QnA](#do-i-need-tft-to-run-the-farmerbot-how-much).

***

### How are dedicated nodes power managed?

Dedicated nodes are managed like any other node. Nodes marked as dedicated can only be rented completely. Whenever a user wants to rent a dedicated node the user sends a find_node job to the farmerbot. The farmerbot will find such a node, power it on if it is down and reserve the full node (for 30 minutes). The user can then proceed with creating a rent contract for that node. The farmerbot will get that information and keep that node powered on. It will no longer return that node as a possible node in future find_node jobs. Whenever the rent contract is canceled the farmerbot will notice this and shutdown the node if the resource usage allows it.

***


### Can I run the Farmerbot on a Raspberry Pi?

It is possible to run the Farmerbot on a Pi. That being said, it is experimental and Threefold might never support it officially.

To run the Farmerbot on a Raspberry Pi, read [this guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-run-farmerbot-on-a-raspberry-pi/3879/).

### I want to set up the Farmerbot for my 3Node farm. Should all my nodes have the same twin ID?

The farmerbot can only manage the nodes that you define in the configuration. So, for each node in your farm, you will need to fill in these required attributes:

* id
  * the id of the node
* twinid
  * the twin id of the node

***

### How can I use GraphQL to see if a 3Node is up or down in relation with the Farmerbot?

This script will show you all the nodes' status on [GraphQL](https://graphql.grid.tf/graphql):

```
query MyQuery {
  nodes {
    nodeID
    power {
      state
    }
  }
}
```

To find a specific node, write the following with the proper nodeID (here we use 655 as an example):

```
query MyQuery {
  nodes(where: {nodeID_eq: 655}) {
    power {
      state
    }
    nodeID
  }
}
```

***

### When setting up the Farmerbot, I get the error: dependency failed to start: container qa-redis-1 is unhealthy. What can I do?

There's some redis database state stored in a persistent volume. The issue is that the database got corrupted somehow and thus redis is crashing.

To remove the volume, and thus actually get a clean start, you can do this:
```
docker compose down -v
```

***

### With the Farmerbot, how can I set a node to never shut down?

In the config file, set the following: `never_shutdown:true` for the node you want to never shut down.

***

### How long does it take for the Farmerbot to do the periodic wake?

The minimum period between two nodes to be waken is currently 5 minutes.
So every 5 minutes a new node wakes up.

Once all nodes are awaken, they all shut down at the same time, except the node that stays awaken to wake up the other during the next periodic wake.

***

###  The Farmerbot is set up and the containers are up and running, but in the logs I see following "Node xxx is not responding while we expect it to: timeout on blpop". Is this an issue?

This always happens when you start the Farmerbot while the nodes are down. Although this is not an issue, it is recommended to have the nodes running when starting the Farmerbot. The nodes data will then be up to date and the nodes that are allowed to be shut down will be shut down.

***

### Does the Farmerbot operate in UTC or local time?

The Farmerbot works in UTC, independently of the local time of your machine.

***

### Setting up the Farmerbot, I get the following error: "Failed initializing the database: Invalid duration value" What can I do to fix this?

If you see this error, it's because you've used 24h time format in conjunction with AM/PM time format. Note that if you add AM/PM, the Farmerbot will use the 12h time format (AM/PM). Otherwise, it is the 24h time format.

***

### How can I update the Farmerbot with the new release?

 Please follow these steps to move the existing farmerbot to the new one:

1. Change the current directory to the directory containing the docker-compose file
2. Download the new docker-compose file: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/farmerbot/development/docker-compose.yaml`
3. Modify the .env file: rename `MNEMONIC` to `SECRET`
4. Stop the existing farmerbot: `docker compose rm -f -s -v`
5. Make a copy of the farmerbot log file: `cp config/farmerbot.log config/farmerbot.log.archive`
5. Run the new farmerbot: `docker compose up -d`

This last command can take some time as it is downloading new docker images. Let the farmerbot run for some time. If you think something is wrong or if you want to check if there is something wrong you should look into the config/farmerbot.log file. If you see some errors please share that file with us.

***

### What are the changes brought in with the new Farmerbot release?

Among new changes, we adjusted the `periodic_wakeup_limit` which allows you to specify how much sleeping nodes you want to wake up at the same time during a periodic wakeup.

Also, we got rid of the requirement to have at least one node up that is unused. So if you have two nodes and one of them is running the Farmerbot the other one will be able to shutdown (it wouldn't shut down before).

### How can I properly stop the Farmerbot and start it again?

Here are the steps to properly stop the Farmerbot and start it again.

* Make sure to fully stop the Farmerbot before starting it again:
  * ```
    docker compose rm -f -s -v
    ```

* You should also make sure that there are no containers left from the previous runs. First, list all containers:
  * ```
    docker container ls --all
    ```

* Then delete the remaining containers:
  * ```
    docker container rm -f -v NAME_OF_CONTAINER
    ```

* To start again the Farmerbot, write the following:
  * ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

### Can I deploy the Farmerbot with Portainer or other container management tools?

The Farmerbot should be compatible with Portainer and other container management tools, but there may be practical issues when deploying the Farmerbot. In that regard, ThreeFold can only support such tools on a best effort basis.

Concerning Portainer, some farmers tried it and it led to issues. It is thus recommended to use something else than Portainer to deploy the Farmerbot.

***

### Can I run multiple Farmerbots on a single computer? How can I install a second Farmerbot for a different farm on the same computer? 

You can run multiple Farmerbots on the same computer, as long as each Farmerbot is associated with only one farm. Note that you also need to have a separate twin for each farm. Currently, each Farmerbot can only control a single twin account, and each twin should only oversee a single farm.

You can follow the same process as with the first Farmerbot, with the new seed phrase associated with the new farm. You simply need to install the second Farmerbot in a different directory and it won't interfere with the other Farmerbot. This means that  each Farmerbot will need its own `.env` and `config` files.

***

### I did an update on my Farmerbot and now all my 3Nodes are waking up. Is this an expected behaviour?

Yes, this is an expected behaviour. When you restart the Farmerbot, it will then proceed to reboot all the 3Nodes of your farm.

***

### I deleted the log files in the config folder, but no new log files have been generated. How can I generate new log files for the Farmerbot?

To generate new log files for the Farmerbot after deleting the original log files, you need to restart the Farmerbot for changes to take effect. 

You should also make sure that you didn't use a different file structure.

***

### When running the Farmerbot, I get the following: "error: UnauthorizedToChangePowerTarget". What can I do to fix this?

It means that the twin associated with the `SECRET` you loaded into the Farmerbot is not the owner of the farm. In other words, this error means that you provided a wrong mnemonic. 

Note that only the twin of the farm is able to set the node power on chain (`setNodePower`). 

***

### How can I manually change the Farmerbot's power target of my 3Nodes?

If you know which nodes are down, you can change the power target manually in the Polkadot extrinsics.

Go to [this link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/extrinsics). Then do the following:

* Under, `submit the following extrinsics`, choose the following:
  * `tfgridModule`
* Then, select the following parameter:
  * `changePowerTarget(nodeId, powerTarget)`
* Under `nodeID`, enter the 3Node ID
* Then, select the power target's status
  * `powerTarget` (up or down)
* Click `submit transaction`

***

### I created my farm with the TFConnect app. What should I put in the parameter SECRET to properly set the Farmerbot?

You need to use the TFChain secret from the farm page on the TFConnect app as the `SECRET`, which is in HEX format. The main template should look like this: `SECRET="0x12345ABCDEF..."`
