## ThreeFold Dashboard

In this guide, we will introduce you to the **ThreeFold Dashboard**, a powerful tool designed to empower individuals and organizations with seamless control and management over their ThreeFold Grid resources. The ThreeFold Dashboard provides an intuitive web-based interface that allows users to effortlessly deploy, monitor, and scale their workloads on the decentralized and sustainable ThreeFold Grid infrastructure. 

The dashboard is a unified admin interface for everything related to Threefold Grid such as:

- **Twin/Farm Management**:

    The TF Twin management feature within the ThreeFold Dashboard enables users to create, manage, and monitor their individual digital entities known as "Twins." A Twin represents a virtual machine (VM) or a container running on the ThreeFold Grid. With Twin management, users can easily deploy and scale their workloads, allocate resources, and configure networking and storage settings for their Twins.

    - Farms Management

    The Farms Management feature allows users to manage their own infrastructure, referred to as "Farms," on the ThreeFold Grid. Farms consist of servers and storage devices that contribute computing and storage capacity to the grid. Through the Farms management feature, users can add or remove, monitor the health and performance of their farms, and efficiently utilize their resources.

- **TFChain DAO**

The TFChain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) feature integrates decentralized governance capabilities into the ThreeFold Dashboard. It enables community members to participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the evolution of the ThreeFold ecosystem. Through the TFChain DAO, users can propose, vote on, and implement changes to the network protocols, policies, and operations, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment.

- **Token Management**
  The Token management feature allows users to securely manage their ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) directly from the ThreeFold Dashboard. Users can view their token balance, perform transactions, and manage their wallet addresses. This feature provides convenience and accessibility for users to engage in token-related activities, such as buying, selling, or transferring TFT within the ThreeFold ecosystem.

    - **Bridging with Binance and Stellar**

    The TFT Bridges feature establishes connections between the ThreeFold blockchain (TFChain) and external blockchain networks like Binance and Stellar. Through this feature, users can bridge their TFT between the ThreeFold blockchain and these external networks, enabling interoperability and facilitating the exchange or utilization of TFT in a broader ecosystem. 

    - **Transferring money to other TFChain user**

    Additionally, users can transfer TFT directly to other TFChain users via TF Dashboard, expanding the possibilities for peer-to-peer transactions within the ThreeFold network.

- **TFGrid Explorer**
  The TFGrid Explorer feature provides a comprehensive view of the ThreeFold Grid infrastructure. Users can explore and analyze information related to ThreeFold nodes, farms, and grid statistics. It also provides insights into the farms contributing to the grid and their respective performance metrics. By utilizing the Explorer, users can access detailed information about individual nodes, including their location, capacity, and availability.
