## Introduction

This section of the ThreeFold Manual introduces you to **ThreeFold Dashboard** section, a powerful tool designed to empower individuals and organizations with seamless control and management over their ThreeFold Grid resources. The ThreeFold Dashboard provides an intuitive web-based interface that allows users to effortlessly monitor, and scale their workloads on the decentralized and sustainable ThreeFold Grid infrastructure.

The ThreeFold Dashboard is a unified admin interface for everything related to the Threefold Grid. We now give an overview of the different features of the ThreeFold Dashboard.

The TF Twin management feature of the ThreeFold Dashboard enables users to create, manage, and monitor their individual digital entities known as **Twins**. A Twin can represent a virtual machine (VM) or a container running on the ThreeFold Grid. With the Twin management, users can easily deploy and scale their workloads, allocate resources, and configure networking and storage settings for their Twins.

The Farms management feature allows users to manage their own infrastructure, referred to as **Farms** on the ThreeFold Grid. Farms consist of servers and storage devices that contribute computing and storage capacity to the grid. Through the Farms management feature, users can add or remove, as well as monitor the health and performance of their farms, all the while efficiently using their resources.
