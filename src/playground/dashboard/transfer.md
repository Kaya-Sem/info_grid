# Transfare

Manage your TFT on TFChain

## Transfer TFT between TFChain accounts

You can transfer TFTs between two accounts that exist on the same chain.

> Remark: testnet and mainnet both have the same TFTs but as the 2 chains are different, there is no way to do a direct transfer between accounts on testnet and on mainnet.

You can transfer TFTs by recipient address or recipient twin id; by selecting the needed tab:

![ ](./img/dashboard_portal_transfer_detail.png ':size=300')

Fill in the recipient address or twin id, the amount of tokens to transfer, and click on `Submit`.

There is no transfer fee, just a signing fee of 0.001 TFT.
