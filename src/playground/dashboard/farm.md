<h1>Farm Management</h1>

The Farms management feature allows users to manage their own infrastructure, referred to as **Farms** on the ThreeFold Grid. Farms consist of servers and storage devices that contribute computing and storage capacity to the grid. Through the Farms management feature, users can add or remove, as well as monitor the health and performance of their farms, all the while efficiently using their resources.
