## Notes

Here are some notes to take into account when doing TFT transfers:

* When you use a bridge going from chain A to chain B, you will have to pay the bridge fees shown above, as well as the fees from the chain A itself, as discussed [here](#chain-fees).
* For gas fees paid directly by users, they will be shown in the user's wallet at transaction time, not on the bridge page.
* The bridge fees can vary based on current on-chain gas prices. The current fee will always be shown on the bridge page before a transaction is initiated.
