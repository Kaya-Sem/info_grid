## Introduction

The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is available on Ethereum.
It is implemented as a wrapped asset with the following token address:

```
0x395E925834996e558bdeC77CD648435d620AfB5b
```

We present here the basic steps to add TFT to Metamask. We also show how to buy TFT Metamask. Finally, we present the simple steps to use the [TFT Ethereum Bridge](https://bridge.eth.threefold.io/).

To add the ThreeFold Token, paste its Ethereum address in the field `Token contract address field`. The address is the following:

```

```

Once you paste the TFT contract address, the parameter `Token symbol` should automatically be filled with `TFT`. 

Click on the button `Add Custom Token`.
