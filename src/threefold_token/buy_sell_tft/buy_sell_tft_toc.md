<h1>Buy and Sell TFT</h1>

> If you're looking for a simple way to get started with TFT, check out the [quick start guide](./quick_start_lobstr.md).

There are multiple ways to buy and sell [TFT](../threefold_token.md) depending on your preferences and the blockchain network you choose to transact on. 

You can buy and sell TFT on [Stellar Chain](./tft_lobstr/tft_lobstr.md), [Ethereum Chain](./tft_metamask/tft_metamask.md) and [Binance Smart Chain](./pancakeswap.md), and you can use the [TFT bridges](../tft_bridges/tft_bridges.md) to go from one chain to another.

For newcomers, we recommend using [Lobstr](./tft_lobstr/tft_lobstr.md) as it is very easy and accessible.

With TFTs, you can [deploy workloads](../../getstarted/tfgrid3_getstarted.md) on the ThreeFold Grid and benefit from [staking discounts](../../wiki/cloudunits/pricing/staking_discount_levels.md) up to 60%!
