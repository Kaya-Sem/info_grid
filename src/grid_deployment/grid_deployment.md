# Grid Deployment

The TFGrid whole source code is open-source and instances of the grid can be deployed by anyone thanks to the distribution of daily grid snapshots of the complete ThreeFold Grid stacks.

Download snapshots of the full grid stacks with rsync and use Docker to quickly deploy your own instance of the TFGrid!
