## Introduction

ThreeFold is an open-source project and anyone can run the full stack of the TFGrid in a totally decentralized manner. In practice, this means that anyone can grab a docker compose file shared by ThreeFold of the TFGrid stacks and run an instance of the grid services on their own domain.

This means that you could host your own dashboard at `dashboard.yourdomain.com` that would serve your own instance of the complete TFGrid stack!

Not only does this allow you to develop and create on top of the TFGrid, but the process is actually very straightforward: run a docker compose file on your server and access your instance of the grid online.

## Concrete Example

For example, there is a TFGrid backend at this URL: [https://dashboard.bknd1.ninja.tf/](https://dashboard.bknd1.ninja.tf/).

Setting such instances of the TFGrid ensures resiliency and decentralization of the ThreeFold ecosystem.

## Run Your Own Stack

To set your own instance of the TFGrid, you can download a snapshot of the grid and deploy the TFGrid services with Docker. We even provide scripts to quicken the whole process!
